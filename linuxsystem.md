The key thing to rememeber here is that these are pretty universal. RPM based operating systems may do things slightly different but fundamentally the core system diretories (dev, var, usr, bin) all function the same. Also keep in mind when you see something like `lib64` that is referring to the 64bit cpu architecture.
